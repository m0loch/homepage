1. polish
    + game over screen that should let the player restart
    + game over animation
    + add more clouds
    + more ground sections + balancing
    + the game should start with the character being idle until the user "jumps"
2. controls and balancing
    + tap for start on mobile
    + is the jump high enough (or too high)?
    + is the speed correct? should it build up?
    + do the tiles need to be bigger?
3. score
    + coins?
    + distance count
4. think of extra mechanics
    + double jump? tap vs hold for higher jump?
