    Yet another month without updates passed by.
    I'm not going to lie, I really lack the energies to keep up with the updates lately.
    Last month I've had health issues while also having to cover for other ill coworkers, and that made me too tired to actually code anything on my spare time.

    In the mean time I (finally) started playing Cyberpunk 2077, and I managed to play a bit of Across the Obelisk, which seem to have some good potential but I think I'll pause for a bit.
