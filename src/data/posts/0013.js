    Almost a month passed since the last update and I want to reassure the both of you that I'm not dead: I just had some health issues (laryngitis followed by COVID) and I PLAYED THE WHOLE HORIZON: FORBIDDEN WEST.

    In order to move things forward a little, I'm now publishing the bare-bones version of the endless runner I worked on a little before this whole situation, even if I'm not really liking it that much.

    I want to also publish a small Tetris clone in the next days, then fix some minor things I'm not really satisfied with (namely: the win popup and the UX of the Projects section).
