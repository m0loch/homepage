            <p>Just a quick, mandatory post to wish everyone a splendid 2023!</p>
            <br />
            <p>I'm two weeks away from starting my new job experience and I'm really excited, even though I've yet to find a place to stay in Milan...</p>
            <br />
            <p>In the meanwhile I'm re-developing Tyles, a puzzle game me and my good friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidejones88/">Davide</a> published for iOS some 5 years ago - just to keep myself busy while struggling for the last two weeks of my old job (PrestaShop I solemnly swear I won't miss you). </p>
            <br />
            <p>The game engine and the levels are already ok, it will be published as soon as I fix some collateral code, like the win screen, the levels' handling etc</p>
            <br />
            <p>Keep yourselves entertained with my Top songs from 2022 according to Spotify:</p>
