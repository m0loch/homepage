    Well, I spent last month playing Yakuza: LaD (really enjoying it, up until the last chapter) and trying to do my part in the realization of a small indie game I want to publish with the guys with whom I made <a href="https://m0loch666.itch.io/bugformer">Bugformer</a> some months ago.

    Today I realized that the Wordle clone is bugged *and* that by releasing the last edits I somehow managed to break the Fifteen's CSS.
    My bad for just reverting to standard CSS when material UI made @mui/styles legacy - I'll figure up something to have more control on what I'm doing, especially because this site is very small and I'm facing this kind of issues already.

    But, for the moment, goodbye Wordle clone.
