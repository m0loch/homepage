    The good news is that I've finished Cyberpunk 2077 and I'm really happy having played it.
    In fact I'm kind of angry at myself for not being able to play it before, but I was really bitter with all the issues I faced in getting my preordered physical copy of the game for the PS4 and, after managing to put my hands on it only in late november 2020, discovering the game was just barely playable.

    Playing it on the PS5 was a great experience though, and the great atmosphere and storytelling made up for the occasional bug here and there (except for Dakota Smith's last gig not triggering on my savefile - that drives me nuts).
    I just resent not being able to unlock the secret ending on my spoiler-free run.

    "Why the title, then?" you may ask.
    Well, I thought I was fully prepared for the worst, but seeing the far-right win the italian elections really breaks my heart, that's why I'm ranting on my secret place on the internet at 3am instead of getting a good night of rest before yet another sad monday at work.
