    I spent a lot of time lately playing Yakuza: Like a Dragon and planning my trip to Paris (in order to attend the wedding of my good friend Diva with Alexis), so I'm sorry I didn't spend much time working on this site.

    Anyway, I'm publishing an updated version of Wordle with some quasi acceptable animations and a slightly better keyboard for mobile.
    Sadly I think I'll need to come up with something more <i>sophisticated</i> for the flipping animation, as the tiles change colour before the start of the animation and THAT SUCKS.
