    I'm back from my short vacation -where we missed the chance to do <b>any</b> kind of work on BugFormer- and, to burn myself immediately out, I've started some revamp to the project section.

    The idea is to add some settings to each game to diversify the experience, and maybe (later down the line) save top scores and things like that.

    For the moment I've rewritten the "Possible followups" section (ngl, that title is crap), but I plan on tackling the other existing sections as well before coming up with a new game.
