            <p>Long story short: rewriting Tetris proved to be much more difficult than expected and I should have scrapped and rewritten it from scratch rather than trying to adapt the code.</p>
            <br />
            <p>The real problem, though, consists in the fact that the pockets of time I can devote to this site are very slim because <b>things are happening</b>.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I hope to be able to come up with some real news in the near future.</p>
            <br />
            <p>In the meantime, do yourself a favor and go play <a href="https://tann.itch.io/slice-dice?ac=qfCyYFQF-tw">Slice & Dice</a></p>
