    I wanted to post an update about the Steam project we're working on, but OBVIOUSLY when I set up the blog part of this mini-page I didn't come up with a way to actually include media in the posts.

    Well, life sucks, especially if you can only blame yourself for the things that are missing.

    We'll see if over the course of the week between working on my regular job AND the game I'll find time to fix this overlook.
