    It's monday morning and I'm tired, and I'm expecting today to be quite a boring day.

    That's why I published yet another Wordle clone, even though I've yet to add working transitions (I'm having trouble with CSS delays, everything will probably just fall into place as soon as I find out what I'm doing wrong).

    In the meantime stay hydrated, and remember that by refreshing the page you'll be immediately in for another word, insteading of having to wait for a full day,
