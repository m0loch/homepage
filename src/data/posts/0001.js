    Really not much of an update, I just wanted to state a bit of my intentions for the future.

    I've published the Mosaic minigame in order to have a working online reference for PIXI.js, but I've yet to come up with a properly way to either choose the starting image or give credit to the author.
    To be completely honest that's not even a priority at the moment, given that this is a zero-traffic site and I'm not gaining any kind of profit for my theft.

    I want to point out that the FF7 remake based wallpaper used for that minigame has been taken from <a>https://syanart.com/</a>, head over there if you want to download the original piece of art or another other great ones.
