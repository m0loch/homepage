    This is the first blog post on my new homepage.

    I don't even remember the last time I had one (we're probably talking of the late 90s, just to give you an idea) but lately I felt like the need of a space of this kind.
    It's not like I lack the ways to keep contact with people or to basically rant as the grumpy old coot I am, it's just that since I've had this transition to the web development I need a space to experiment on, and I need it to be public in order to be forced to not just forget about it after a while.

    Well, this is all I have for you today.
