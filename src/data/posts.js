    This is the first blog post on my new homepage.

    I don't even remember the last time I had one (we're probably talking of the late 90s, just to give you an idea) but lately I felt like the need of a space of this kind.
    It's not like I lack the ways to keep contact with people or to basically rant as the grumpy old coot I am, it's just that since I've had this transition to the web development I need a space to experiment on, and I need it to be public in order to be forced to not just forget about it after a while.

    Well, this is all I have for you today.

    Really not much of an update, I just wanted to state a bit of my intentions for the future.

    I've published the Mosaic minigame in order to have a working online reference for PIXI.js, but I've yet to come up with a properly way to either choose the starting image or give credit to the author.
    To be completely honest that's not even a priority at the moment, given that this is a zero-traffic site and I'm not gaining any kind of profit for my theft.

    I want to point out that the FF7 remake based wallpaper used for that minigame has been taken from <a>https://syanart.com/</a>, head over there if you want to download the original piece of art or another other great ones.
